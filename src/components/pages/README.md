## No chemistry — here are old kind pages, which give us a context of our templates

As for example, I would suggest some pages with a strong context. If you are familiar
with ITCSS, the analogy would be Layouts. Combining sections, sidebars, menus in a particular way — could be described there. Pages give us skeleton —
one, two, etc. columns, grid sets, blocks combinations.

There we could put templates for pages. Perhaps you have page--article.html.twig,
so you could put it to this folder as well.

If there are just few scss components (pages), that would be okay. That's normal. Pages are rarely used in projects
